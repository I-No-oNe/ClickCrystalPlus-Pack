## Important clarification:
- As of now, in my opinion the texture is perfect (99%), so I ***will not continue working on it in the near future***, if there are any problems/suggestions you know how to find me **(When Minecraft receives major updates to the textures, I will also update this texture).**
- **Please be aware that I am not leaving but taking a break!**
- Im suggeting to use the [`Suppress OpenGL Error 128 mod`](https://modrinth.com/mod/suppressopengl1280) with this pack, this is result from bug on the texture, for more info press [**here**](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-228532) (please be aware this mod is currently for 1.20.1).
- This texture isn't providing an unfair advantages (also known as **hacks**), so please stop **judging** the texture pack.
